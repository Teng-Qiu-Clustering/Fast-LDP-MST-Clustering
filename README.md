# FastLDPMST
 FastLDPMST: an efficient density-based clustering method for large-size datasets

# Quick start
**Demo1.m** and **Demo2.m** were successfully tested on Matlab2018

Note: 

1) for **Demo 1**, you can choose different datasets (**shown in the datasets section**) to test.

2) for **Demo 2**, the clustering results may be different in different runs, because the test datasets in Demo2 are randomly sampled from some density functions (i.e., the test datasets are different in different runs). Note that the proposed method is not sensitive to the initialization (i.e., for the same dataset, the proposed method will show the same result in different runs. This can be demonstrated by Demo 1).
