# FastLDPMST
 FastLDPMST: an efficient density-peak-based clustering method for large-size datasets

# Quick start
**Demo1.m** and **Demo2.m** were successfully tested on Matlab2018

Note: 

1) for Demo 1, you can choose different datasets (**shown in the datasets section**) and different methods (**shown in the Methods section**) to test.

2) for Demo 2, there may be difference for the result in different runs, because the test datasets in Demo2 are randomly sampled from some density functions (that is, the test datasets are different in different runs). Note that the proposed method is not sensitive to the initialization (that is, for the same dataset, the proposed method will show the same result, as demonstrated by Demo 1).
